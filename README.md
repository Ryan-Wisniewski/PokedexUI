## convert SearchHistory by number to the name after searching by number

## Would like to put searchHistory in order by id

## Just cache it.. (very slow) #Redo with redux. (for speed)

## change "no known location" on a few that are found

## Take elements for Type and Color and extract the title into so it doesnt repeat

## Scrub the - out of pokemon

## typing a number out of range or pokemon is nul  will lead to a null page

## was noticing a bug when very occasionally filter.map is undefined in gender

## Shorten the Locations list for the few that have a bunch of location

## add a 2 components for "more moves" and "more locations" to see all available

## alola region pokemon dont have data for the /species/ endpoint

# The Runtime is very slow - 
## TODO: 
## Extend the getImgURL.py to include all the data I need for all 807 pokemon
## Instead of using a URL for the image grab the BLOB to cache directly to the App
## Remove the large chain of api calls. Instead grab everything from the data obj pokeImg.json
### Would save network bandwidth as well as increase performance for the over all App
### TTL/TTR create a store with useContext, and explore useHistory further. (specifically history.goBack() looks interesting)
